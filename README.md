Network Monitoring Server

A customized network monitoring server written in Go. To manage the expected high traffic to this server I used the gorilla websocket.
This server is partnered with a customized network client that runs in every terminal that needs to be monitored.

The Dashboard UI is written using Vue.js javascript framework.
